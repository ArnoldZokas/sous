#!/usr/bin/env bash

# This script is designed to speed up the development feedback cycle on OS X.
#
# usage: ./bin/watch [command]
#
# [command] will be executed after every successful build and test, you can use it
# e.g. to run a particular sous subcommand after each build to monitor its output.
#
# It relies on fswatch and terminal-notifier (you can get them both using homebrew)
#
# It watches for changes, and if it detects them it takes the following actions:
#
#    1. If you have sous installed via Homebrew, it's removed.
#    2. If you have sous installed via `go install` it's removed.
#    3. Runs `go install`
#    4. Runs `go test ./...`
#    5. Notifies you of the result verbally, and with desktop notifications.
